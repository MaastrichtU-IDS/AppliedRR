# WELCOME

Welcome to the workshop number 4: More about inferential stats with R.

**Learning outcomes:**
By the end of this assignment(s), you should be able to:

•	Know-how to perform t.test for paired data

•	Know-how to conduct and use One-way Anova test

•	Know-how to use chi-square for independent

## Paired t-test

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/643/1*c3I4Px2ezjbWu3SiInRCKA.jpeg)

As you already know, t-Tests are a great way of identifying if two group means are statistically different. This can be done by comparing a sample to the population (one-sample) or comparing two different samples (two-sample).T-tests are further broken down into two categories: unpaired t-tests and paired t-tests. This tutorial will focus on the latter.


### Import Dataset:


To illustrate the paired t-test, we will use the Student's Sleep Data.

*Description*
Data which show the effect of two soporific drugs (increase in hours of sleep compared to control) on 10 patients.

*Format*
A data frame with 20 observations on 3 variables.

[, 1]	extra	numeric	increase in hours of sleep
[, 2]	group	factor	drug given
[, 3]	ID	factor	patient ID

Use the build-in `sleep` function to directly import into R the data set. Please, run the following R command:

```{r}
# import R data set 'sleep'
sleep <- sleep
```

**Visualisation**

```{r}
boxplot(sleep$extra ~ sleep$group,
        col = c("red", "blue"),
        ylab = 'extra sleep',
        xlab = 'groups',
        main = 'formula = extra ~ groups')

```

### DEMO:

**Q1. How would you create the same boxplot using ggplot library? How would you fix this error?**

_Hint_: Check the official documentation for ggplot2: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-box-plot-quick-start-guide-r-software-and-data-visualization

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(sleep, aes(x=groups, y=extra, color=groups)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

**Q2. Research question: Is there a statistically significant effect of the drug on sleep hours?**

```{r echo=FALSE}
t.test(x = sleep$extra[sleep$group == 1],
       y = sleep$extra[sleep$group ==2],
       paired = TRUE)
```

**Q3. What if we want to test the hypothesis that mean of group A is less than group B? Which parameter do you need to declare from the `t.test(0)` method?**

```{r echo=FALSE}
t.test(x = sleep$extra[sleep$group == 1],
       y = sleep$extra[sleep$group ==2],
       paired = TRUE)
```

## Analysis of the Variance (ANOVA)


### What is one-way ANOVA test?

The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), also known as one-factor ANOVA, is a statistical technique, commonly used to study differences between two or more group means. In one-way ANOVA, the data is organized into several groups base on one single grouping variable (also called factor variable). This section describes the basic principle of the one-way ANOVA test and provides practical anova test examples in R software.

### ANOVA test hypotheses:

Null hypothesis: the means of the different groups are the same.
Alternative hypothesis: At least one sample mean is not equal to the others.

*Note that, if you have only two groups, you can use t-test. In this case the F-test and the t-test are equivalent*.

#### General steps to conduct an ANOVA
Here are the 2 steps you should follow to conduct a standard ANOVA in R:

1. Create an ANOVA object using the `aov()` function. In the `aov()` function, specify the independent and dependent variable(s) with a formula with the format `y ~ x1`  where `y` is the dependent variable, and x1, are one (more more) factor independent variables.

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# Step 1: Create an object (you can call it mod.aov)
mod.aov <- aov(formula = y ~ x1,
               data = data)
```


2. Create a summary ANOVA table by applying the `summary()` function to the ANOVA object you created in Step 1.

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
# Step 2: Look at a summary of the aov object
summary(mod.aov)
```

### Import dataset

Here, we’ll use the built-in R data set named PlantGrowth. It contains the weight of plants obtained under a control and two different treatment conditions.

```{r}
plants <- PlantGrowth # import dataset with R built function
# show the levels == categpries
levels(plants$group)

```

### Check your data
To have an idea of what the data look like, we use the the function head(). The head() function randomly picks a few of the observations in the data frame to print out:

```{r}
head(plants)
```

Note: In R terminology, the column “group” is called factor and the different categories (“ctr”, “trt1”, “trt2”) are named factor levels. The levels are ordered alphabetically.

```{r}
# Show the levels

levels(plants$group)
```


### DEMO

**Q1: Create summary statistics by group. Why this error appears and how to solve it?**

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
summarise(group_by(my_data, group),
          count = n(),
          mean = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
              sd = sd(weight, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

```


**Visualise the data**

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
boxplot(my_data$weight ~ my_data$group,
        col = c("red", "blue","yellow"),
        ylab = 'weight',
        xlab = 'groups',
        main = 'formula = weight ~ groups')

```


**Compute one-way ANOVA test**

*Question: We want to know if there is any significant difference between the average weights of plants in the 3 experimental conditions*

_Hint_: check official documentation: https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/aov

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# Step 1: aov object with weight as DV and groups as IV
plant.aov <- aov(formula = weight ~ group,
                   data = my_data)
```


Now, to see a full ANOVA summary table of the ANOVA object, apply the summary() to the ANOVA object from Step 1.

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# Step 2: Look at the summary of the anova object
summary(plant.aov)
```


## Chi-square: chsq.test()

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ch8nhtIUgAA-hxi.jpg)


```{r}
# Create contingency table
ResponsableDS <-  as.table(rbind(c(100, 150, 20),
                                 c(20, 30, 180)))
dimnames(ResponsableDS) <- list(gender = c("Boys",
                                           "Girls"),
                                course= c("Statistics", "Computer Science","Ethics & Responsability"))


ResponsableDS # call the contingency table

```
```{r}

# use chisq() function
(Xsq <- chisq.test(ResponsableDS))  # Prints test summary
Xsq$observed
Xsq$expected
```
